Project research / road map : 
------------------------------------

1) Research the ideal settings for games depending on the PC. 

2) implement the API to fetch the PC configuration of the user 

3) based on the configuration, display the ideal settings for that particular game on a webpage.  


Example Front-end wepage design pattern :
------------------------------------

Game : GTA 5-> 

Processor core i 3 / 8gb ram  : -> 

Improve FPS (by a large amount) with a moderate impact on visuals . 

Population Density: Lower this to between 25 and 0%.
Grass Quality: This makes the biggest difference if you are getting frame rate drops in heavily forested areas. Lower this to normal.
Post FX: Lower this to normal or high.
Turn MSAA off.

Very last resort:

Set everything as low as you can tolerate.
If you try all of the above and still canâ€™t run the game as smoothly as you would like, you may need to upgrade your hardware.


Processor core i 5 / 8gb ram  :

Improve FPS (slightly) by following the settings below : 

Distance Scaling: Lower this to under 30%.
Shadow Quality: Lower this to either High or Normal.
Reflection MSAA: Lower this from 8x MSAA to at least 4x MSAA.
Water Quality: Lower this to Normal.
Extended Distance Scaling: Lower this to under 30%.
Shader Quality: Lower this to Normal.
Reflection Quality: Lower this to either High or Normal.


Here we are suggesting the in game settings based on the processor. 


we Would also add the minimum and maximum requirements which the game developers suggest for a reference to get an idea of where the users PC standards.
