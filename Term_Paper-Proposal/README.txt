Term-Paper- Title : Web application vulnerabilities, detection and Testing. 

Abstract: 
---------

Web-application security is a serious concern with almost all websites and applications on the internet requiring some personal information from the end user. 

With the increase in unauthorized use of personal data and privacy breach, it is important for website developers to understand the vulnerabilities of web applications and how to detect and test the application for potential threats.

The paper will include a survey on web threats like SQL injections, cross-site scripting, broken authentication and how testing techniques can help in early detection of these vulnerabilities in order to ensure the security and confidentiality of data and information.
