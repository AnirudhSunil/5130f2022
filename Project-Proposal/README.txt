Project Topic: Creating a responsive Web Application

Most of the users tend to use the website/application through cell phones, tablets and many more smaller devices. 

At a time when not everyone can afford to carry a personal computer with them everywhere, a responsive website can be useful since it can adapt to any screensize and orientation which enbales the user to access infromation in any situation. 


Better user Experience : 
----------------------

A responsive website can not only help in viewing information on any screen orientaion but can enhance the user experience by optimizing the website in such a way that it can load faster than a standard "Mobile vertsion" of a desktop website. 

A fast website can help in growing a business and attracting new customers, which helps in gaining a solid online presense and gain longterm and trusting customer base. 

Avoiding Duplicate Content : 
--------------------------

Having two versions of a website can result in creating duplicate content. This forces the developer to keep multiple versions of the same website which can lead to confusion of which version would be relavant and updated. 

Sometimes , the mobile version might not have features which the desktop version can offer. 


To conclude, a responsive website is the need of the hour for any website developer.
